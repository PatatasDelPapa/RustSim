# RustSim
A process oriented discrete simulation library

### Requirements
This library uses experimental feature coroutines.

To use this library you need Rust nightly with version at least v1.75 but a greater version with support for `#![feature(coroutines))` will likely work too.

### Running the examples

You can run the examples with
```
cargo run --examples
```

you may also use
```
cargo run --example [example_name]
```
to run a single example.
